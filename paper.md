# Summary

The `PCRedux` package contains function and data sets for machine learning on 
quantitative PCR data in R. There are numerous software packages for R which can 
be used for the analysis of quantitative PCR (qPCR) data [@rodiger_r_2015, @pabinger_survey_2014].

- A summary describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software
for a diverse, non-specialist audience
- A clear statement of need that illustrates the purpose of the software
- A list of key references including a link to the software archive
- Mentions (if applicable) of any ongoing research projects using the software
or recent scholarly publications enabled by it
