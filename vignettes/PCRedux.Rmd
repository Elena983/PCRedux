The `PCRedux` was published in the Journal of Open Source Software under the title [PCRedux: A Quantitative PCR Machine Learning Toolkit](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.04407). This leads to the most complete documentation about the package.

Note that we had to remove one function from the package, because the `bcp` package was [archived](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bcp). This means one feature less in the `pcrfit_single()` function and the related functions.

As the size of PCRedux vignette greatly exceeds the CRAN limits, but we do not see any way to shorten it, the vignette was moved here: https://github.com/PCRuniversum/PCRedux-supplements/blob/master/PCRedux.pdf.
